# WeeklyProject
I joined the weekly project club https://weeklyproject.club/ and will be updating my progress here. Not sure if the updates will be weekly though 

I will not provide the problems (you should joing the project) but I will keep track on my solutions (hopefully is useful for someone or someone can makes suggestions to me to improve)

The programming language I chose is...python, of course.
